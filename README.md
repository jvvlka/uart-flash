UART Communication Protocol with Flash Memory Management
1. Implement communication between a microcontroller and a PC using interrupts and circular buffers via an asynchronous interface (UART).

2. Design and implement a communication protocol that allows for:

- Packet addressing,

- Transmission of arbitrary data,

- Verification of data integrity including correct sequence handling.

3. Create functions for storing and retrieving data structures in flash memory.

- Use two separate flash pages for saving,

- Enable detection of the most recent version of the data.
